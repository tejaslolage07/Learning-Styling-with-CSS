    <!-- There are 4 values for the display tag which are:
        1. display: inline -> Takes only the space required by the element. No linebreaks before and after. Setting width and height is not allowed here.
                            and top and bottom margin/padding is not allowed. However, horizontal margin/padding can be set. 
        2. display: block (default) -> takes full space available in width and leaves a newline before and after the element.
        3. display: inline-block -> similar to inline, but can allow setting height, width, margin and padding. Elements can sit next to each other here as well.
        4. display: none -> the element is removed from the document flow. It's space is not blocked.
        5. visibility: hidden: the object will not be visible anymore, but still it will occupy its space.      -->
